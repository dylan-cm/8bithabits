# 8bithabits

This project was generated with [Stylish React Redux](https://github.com/wurst-case/generator-stylish-react-redux). Refer to `docs/stylish-react-redux` to find more information on how to perform common tasks.

This generator was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Once the installation is done, you can run some commands inside the project folder:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode.<br>
By default, runs tests related to files changes since the last commit.

[Read more about testing.](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#running-tests)

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
